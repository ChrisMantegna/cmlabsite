### October Goal Reflection

*What worked, what didn't, where can I improve*

#### What Worked

-   I planned my bench time and put it on my calendar.
-   I set a meeting date for the committee meeting to meet a goal of
    bypass in Winter Quarter.

#### What Didn't

-   I didn't follow- up on data availability or process fast enough.\
-   I didn't spend my time waiting for data to clarify the workflow for
    eDNA bioinformatics pipeline.

#### Improve

-   Spend time at the beginning of each week not just mapping out
    'outside' obligations but tasks that are involved in my own work.
-   Block dedicated time for my work, not just work impacting others. Do
    this by breaking down to the task- level of the project and then
    adding individual tasks to my calendar.
-   Schedule 'bench' time for coding and computer- based work.
