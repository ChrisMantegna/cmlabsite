* I received the SICB Broadening Participation Award! I am very excited and it will help to pay for the yellow students to get to the conference.\

* I met with Nikki Traylor-Knowles to discuss the path to professor as a Black woman. What are some skills/ strengths I should work on now, what are some pitfalls I should avoid, and is it better to postdoc or bypass postdoc positions if possible?\

* Kristina Canonizado and I met to review her capstone proposal, research questions and a general overview of her project over the next two quarters. We refined her questions, mainly adjusting the scope to a manageable project size, and looking up resources for further research before finalizing her proposal.
