* Mussel mantle tissue DNA shipped out to Psomagen and sent them an updated order form. 
* Working on biomarker visualizations led me to return to the regressions. Given the high co-linearity of the analytes a multiple regression model won't be a truthful representation of the impact of the individual analytes- there is something to be said about the categories of significant analytes, this may suggest that the p450 response is more expanded than the straight aromatic hydrocarbons OR that the mussels in the areas of highest contaminant load have just maxed out their enzyme expression. I have more literature to go through before I can really articulate what I'm thinking.
