* Mussel mantle tissue DNA shipped out to Psomagen and sent them an updated order form. 
* Working on biomarker visualizations led me to return to the regressions. Given the high co-linearity of the analytes a multiple regression model won't be a truthful representation of the impact of the individual analytes- there is something to be said about the categories of significant analytes, there is something up with the correlations. I have more literature to go through before I can really articulate what I'm thinking.
* Spent some time reviewing methods in biomarker papers about fish and bivalves.
