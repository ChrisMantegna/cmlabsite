## December Goal Reflection

*What worked, what didn't, where can I improve*

#### What Worked

-   I set a boundary with my workload and didn't present at AGU, just
    spent my time listening to plenaries and staffing the BIMS booth.

#### What Didn't

-   It felt like everything went wrong at some point which is an
    indicator of overload. If things of varying magnitude feel
    overwhelming when they jump the track there isn't enough space to
    adjust. I was way too overloaded coming into the last month of the
    year and it showed.

#### Improve

-   Take whatever I believe I can accomplish and cut it in half.
-   Going back to basic habit tracking to see where I'm losing time/
    momentum in task shifts.
