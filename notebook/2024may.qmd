-   Started grading student essays and catching up on this week's
    content.
-   Monthly mentoring meeting with Julia.
-   Worked with Ly to pick out sites she'll evaluate for her capstone
    and talked through the visuals she'd like to use for her poster.
    We'll move forward with highly urbanized, less urbanized and
    reference for her project.
-   Set monthly goals for May.
