- Met with Savannah at Sea Potential to discuss shift in workload due to personnel changes.
- Attended the last 30 minutes of Pubathon. No points for me this week as I didn't meet my goals of getting the raw data into the WDFW repo and completing 30% source annotation for the mussel biomarker paper.
- TA'd 401.
- Attended lab meeting where we discussed upcoming lab meeting content, bringing in undergrads for the summer, and plans for potential experiments.
- Attended the Husky 100 reception.

-   Started grading student essays and catching up on this week's
    content.
-   Monthly mentoring meeting with Julia.
-   Worked with Ly to pick out sites she'll evaluate for her capstone
    and talked through the visuals she'd like to use for her poster.
    We'll move forward with highly urbanized, less urbanized and
    reference for her project.
-   Set monthly goals for May.
