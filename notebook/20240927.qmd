-   Attended Science Hour - twice - to touch base with Steven about an Innovation Grant expense and talk about upcoming lab meeting/ department community building opportunities.\

-   I started pulling together my presentation for the Salish Sea Sciences group coming on October 2nd.\

-   I built a daily and weekly workflow for my RUA tasks, and I built an applicant tracker that is coordinator- facing. The master lists for the data collection and overall program are not useful for task management, so I put one together to keep track of where folks are in the pipeline.
