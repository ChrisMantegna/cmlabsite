- I started the day by knocking out the 'little' tasks that pile up. I checked in with my SICB 2025 folks to get an update on travel funding for each. I cleaned out my meeting notes and added the appropriate action items to my schedule and task manager.I cleaned out my pending emails, and I caught up with the eFAST folks to try to push my reimbursements along.\

- I edited/ provided feedback on Luis' statements for his SICB Broadening Participation application and returned them to him. I also touched base with Ben re: his REU paper and his next steps.\

- I finally knocked out the biomarker correlation plots and am working on trying to figure out how to breakdown the large correlation plots for shell thickness.
