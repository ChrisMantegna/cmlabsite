-   First half of the day was spent working on RUA tasks.\

-   I moved on to troubleshoot the Yellow Island 2024 quadrat data. I identified one of the sections missing data and began entering where the summer students left off. It appears that there is at least one more section that is short, and I will tackle that once I knock this one out.\

-   Attended the weekly BGG meeting. We worked on balancing professional milestones and workload with personal management.
