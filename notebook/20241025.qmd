* Completed and submitted my Broadening Participation application. This is an award from SICB that provides up to $500 in professional development funds to the recipient.\

* Attended science hour and discussed writing the discussion section of the biomarker paper as well as conducting a time series trial where we can pinpoint the maximum threshold of the enzyme production. This wouldnâ€™t be a part of the paper, but something that I think is necessary to investigate if I am going to continue doing mussel work.\

* Met with Brandon to discuss RUA website stuff.\

* Left for Hama Hama.
