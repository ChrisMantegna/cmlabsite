-   Attended RUA meetings and began building workflow and familiarity with platforms and tasks for my upcoming SAship for the 24 - 25 AY.\

-   Refreshed my familiarity with the eDNA bioinformatics pipeline to get rolling on some base analysis for my 9/24 meeting with Camille.\

-   Touched base with Ben to review his REU paper progress and how to meet the October deadline.
