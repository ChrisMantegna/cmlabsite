-   September 7. Saturday. No work done.\
-   September 8. Sunday. I verified my biomarker work from Friday, finished the base plots for what will create the manuscript plots, and put them together in a powerpoint and sent them over to Alison to take a look at. Most notably, the email contained an explanation of the change in results as we have solid correlations based on the correct correlation method.
