# Monthly Goals

## February Goals

My goal this month is to reset. I have struggled through meeting deadlines and future task planning, so I am resetting this month. My responsibilities don't wane but my focus and productivity do. Q1 is a quarter to reset while producing my first, first- authored manuscript.
