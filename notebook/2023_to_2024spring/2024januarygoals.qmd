## December Goal Reflection

*What worked, what didn't, where can I improve*

#### What Worked

-   Very little. It was difficult to stay on task, manage unexpected
    time- sucks and expected road blocks.

#### What Didn't

-   It felt like everything went wrong at some point which is an
    indicator of overload. If things of varying magnitude feel
    overwhelming when they jump the track there isn't enough space to
    adjust. I was way too overloaded coming into the last month of the
    year and it showed.

#### Improve

-   Take whatever I believe I can accomplish and cut it in half.
-   Say 'No'.\
-   Move forward with attention and alignment. The days of saying yes to
    opportunities because they are presented are on their way out.
