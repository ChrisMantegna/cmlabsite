-   I updated [GitHub Issue #1948](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1948) with the gel from yesterday and am awaiting input on how to proceed with the epigenetics project.\
-   I am still working on biomarker figures to present to Alison and Steven before we meet on Friday. I derailed myself a bit by taking the correlation results to the individual biomarkers and trying to see if a regression would give us a clearer picture of what is driving the biomarker response. So far, regressions don't provide any supporting or new information that is useful.\
