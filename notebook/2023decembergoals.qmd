## November Goal Reflection

*What worked, what didn't, where can I improve*

#### What Worked

-   Small amounts of daily progress over large chunks of work blocks
-   I was clear about my limitations and stuck to imminent projects.
    This resulted in going to AGU as a BIMS ambassador only instead of
    going as an ambassador and presenting.

#### What Didn't

-   I didn't make a comprehensive list of steps to accomplish each goal.
-   I didn't spend my time waiting for data to clarify the workflow for
    eDNA bioinformatics pipeline.

#### Improve

-   Prioritize workload and then create steps, it is clear that not all
    steps for all projects are a priority.
-   Work on switching tasks and making better documentation to support
    shifting between tasks to encourage overall progress, not just an
    'all or nothing' outcome.
-   Consistently schedule 'bench' time for coding and computer- based
    work at the beginning of the week when I do my weekly schedule
    review.
