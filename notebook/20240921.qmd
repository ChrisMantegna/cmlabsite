-   Saturday
-   Updated my lab notebook.\

-   Spent the morning setting my schedule/ workflow for fall quarter. I know I need to block my time on my calendar to help me task switch and prevent 'project bleed' from one project into the time for another. I also pre-scheduled breaks and built out some workflows that will help me to identify where I need task support and where I need to decrease or increase the amount of time I have blocked for tasks.\

-   Spent the afternoon working on eDNA analysis workflow.
