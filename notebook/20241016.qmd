-   Headed up to FHL to give the weekly seminar. Delivered the 1 hour seminar on the mussel biomarker work to mostly students and some of the faculty on campus. The Q&A afterward was really interactive - the students had great questions and benefitted from hearing work that didn't produce 'rockstar' results.\

-   Met with Becca Maher, Olivia Graham and Marjorie Wonham about current projects and the upcoming NWStraits Commission conference.
