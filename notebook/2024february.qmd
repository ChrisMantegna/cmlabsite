## 22 February 2024

- Put together resources and my bio for the Marine Bio seminar.
- Attended lab meeting where we discussed and troubleshot experimental designs for Kathleen and Sarah.
- Met with Sea Potential to set up a science educator meeting in May. I will be the marine biologist 6-10 high school students will meet on May 8th in the lab. We discussed the logistics of this 4 hour session. I am excited to work through a lesson for them that is hands-on.
- Met with Ly so we could discuss the progress on the biomarker data. We worked on framing her capstone and next steps for our meeting next week. 
- Held office hours for ENV 100.
- Worked on my lab notebook. I am trying to clean up my site and make it a useful tool.I'm going to make some adjustments so that it showcases my science, my mentorship/ teaching, and my guiding principles in a way that doesn't sound overly douchey.

## 21 February 2024

- Attended ENV lecture and held essay support drop-ins.
- Attended BGG weekly meeting.
- Began framing/ outlining my seminar presentation for Marine Biology Seminar next week.

## 20 February 2024

- Grading and essay review sessions with the ENVIR students.
- Biomarker visualizations.

## 19 February 2024

- Monday. Off.

## 18 February 2024

- Sunday. Off.

## 17 February 2024

- Saturday. Attend the Eco Afro Futures Community event in Oakland. It was day full of speakers, experts in community and the work, and future thinking. I was so excited to share space with other folks whose vision for environmental health and change is rooted in community and inclusionary practices.

## 16 February 2024

- Attended ENV lecture and held the final quiz section of the week.
- Attended FAB accountability meeting where I revamped my weekly retros and calendar blocking to reduce the task swapping induced loss of focus.

## 15 February 2024

- Held Quiz Section AJ for fellow TA that was out sick, held office hours and finished weekly grading for ENV 100.
- Finished SOD calculations for the qc run and most of the values are still out of range. The solution to dilute either the samples or the standards was unsuccessful.

## 14 February 2024

- Attended Taylor's defense via zoom and watched her become a DOCTOR!
- Worked on catching up with emails and deliverables to the biomarkers team, the eDNA team, and the innovation grant team.
- Mentor session with Julia where we discussed framing a dissertation, my Nature Opinion piece, and where to place boundaries on geography frameworks for my work.
- Attended BGG meeting.

## 13 February 2024

- Meeting with Camille to go over the 2023 Yellow island eDNA data. We will meet every three weeks or so to touch base on the analysis and the eventual paper that will come from the work.
- Meeting with Ly to go over our current biomarker data. We will meet weekly to do the analysis and the the prep for her Capstone poster.
- DDCSP mentor meeting with Martha and the scholars that are interested in the Yellow Island program for their summer experience. I met two great scholars and got to overlap with Taylor, a former mentee and new DDCSP mentor this year.
- Completed my portion of midterm grading for ENV 100.

## 12 February 2024

- Attended ENV 100 lecture and teaching team meeting.
- Led both Quiz Sections and their respective UW Farms tours.
- FAB Writing accountability where I worked on the qc run of my SOD values that were out of range. The problem here is that the qc values appear to also be out of range for the diluted samples. This leads me to question whether or not diluting in the sample buffer like they suggest is creating interference.

## 11 February 2024

- Sunday Race Day!
- Prepared for Quiz Section this week.

## 10 February 2024

- Saturday. UWT lab day. I reran the 109 samples that fell beyond the standard curve for the SOD assay. About half fell below the curve and half above. For the lower end samples, I diluted all of the standards to lower the curve. I used a 50% reduction, a 10- fold reduction, and a 100- fold reduction. For the higher end samples, I diluted the samples by half. Because most of the high samples were more than double the upper limit on their respective standard curves, I halved the concentration and then plated each with the full standard and the 50% reduction to ensure the samples that weren't that high in protein content would also fall in one curve or the other.
- Held office hours from 10am - 12pm for students to get support for their persuasive essay drafts.
- Was a preliminary audience member for Taylor's practice run through of her dissertation.

## 9 February 2024

- Started the day with my last Taylor writing accountability meeting! I worked on framing my DDCSP presentation for the upomng week's cohort. 
- Attended ENV lecture and held my final quiz section of the week.

- Attended the Town Hall sponsored evening with Ijeoma Oluo, the Seattle writer that has a new book, Be A Revolution, release. 

## 8 February 2024

- Attended NW CASC information session for their newest RFP.
- Attended "Ecotoxicology in Aquatic Ecosystems: Behavior as a Tool" virtual panel held by the Instituto de Ciencias del Mar y Limnolog√≠a. The panelists were from differing backgrounds and presented interesting work and discussion about behavioral assessment as a tool and to tease out physiologically relevant questions. There was a huge emphasis on the work ares of least abundance, and that was helpful for focusing future study efforts.

## 7 February 2024
