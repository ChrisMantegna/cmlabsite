## 12 January 2024

- Attended ENV lecture and led quiz section.
- Held writing accountability with Taylor. I worked on p450 methods and some ideas for my Hall Conservation Proposal.
 - FAB schedule retro and teaching evaluation review.

## 11 January 2024

- UWT lab day. Ly finished pulling out tissue for the p450 redo and made it to the halfway mark on tissue dissection for SOD assay prep. I finished homogenate processing for the last 75 samples for the p450 QC run. Next step is to plate and run BCA and p450 to compare to the tests for BFC test and initial p450 results.
- Attended lab meeting but left after 30 minutes to attend to a tank failure in the Gardell lab that was leaking water across the floor.
- Met with WDFW folks to discuss authorship and results on the p450 paper. In addition to myself, Steven and Alison we will be adding Mariko, Danielle and Molly from WDFW.
- Attended the Salish Sea Institute webinar "Sharing Knowledge Across Disciplines & Borders" where I learned about the initiatives of the WWU- housed organization and some opportunities to work with them when doing Salish Sea work.

## 10 January 2024

- Attended ENV 100 lecture and started grading.
- Met with Jose to discuss an upcoming mentor call and potential co-authorship on a paper about ocean science pedagogy.
- Met with Matt to work out basic logistics for the 2024 Yellow Island season.
- Reviewed p450 work from the day prior. The plate shows the appropriate gradation in BFC across all three mediums (microsomal buffer, DI water, and sample). The blanks were a bit inconsistent, but the rest of the result lends itself as confirmation that the preliminary results we got in December were accurate. Ly and I will rerun the last batch of 75 samples with odd BCA values in the next few days.

## 09 January 2024

- UWT lab day. I updated the tissue prep protocol for the p450 assays to mitigate some of the interference we saw in the first round of data acquisition. After that I ran a test assay to assess fluorescence levels with the BFC across a gradient, with and without sample, and with and without buffer and DI water. The result of that plate is that 

## 08 January 2024

- Attended ENV lecture, teaching team meeting, and led two of my three quiz sections.
- Watched my Huskies lose the CFP to Michigan.

## 07 January 2024

## 06 January 2024

- Saturday. Attended SICB.

## 05 January 2024

-  Writing accountability with Taylor where I worked on Yellow Island program review.
- Attended ENV lecture.
- Attended SICB and made my first conference presentation. I presented on using eDNA for biodiversity assessment in complement with physical methods.

## 04 January 2024

- Attended SICB in the morning.
- Worked on my SICB presentation in the afternoon and  evening.

## 03 January 2024

-   Worked on my presentation storyline.
-   Attended ENV 100 lecture.
-   Attended SICB. Watched Zach's talk, setup posters with Logan and the
    REU students from the summer and then attended the poster session.

## 02 January 2024

-   Completed the preliminary Yellow Island Program website and prepared
    for lecture and TA meeting this week.
