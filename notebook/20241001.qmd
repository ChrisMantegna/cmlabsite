 - Matt and I met to frame out or TNC post and to talk about meeting with the YNC science team at the end of this month. We also spent some time checking- in on the relationship building we've been doing over the past few weeks to support a quiet Yellow year.\
 
 - I decided against submitting an application to the ASLO MP program. Even though the application outlines the student levels they accept for submission - including graduate students, it felt like the program was more geared to undergraduates and new grad students.\
 
 - I completed my end of the month stats to see where I spent my time in September.
