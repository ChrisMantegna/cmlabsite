-   Attended the FAB writing accountability session where I worked on the edits to the methods section of the biomarker paper and got back to adjusting the correlation plots for the same paper.\

-   Attended a book talk given by Dr. Ayanna Elizabeth Johnson at Elliot Bay Books. She discussed some of the process of writing *What if We Get it Right?* with her fact- checker, James Gaines. It was awesome. I really appreciated the conversation about how we use language, how we tell stories and how to re-frame climate action for our communities.
