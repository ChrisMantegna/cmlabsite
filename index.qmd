## won't you celebrate with me

by [Lucille
Clifton](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/lucille-clifton)

won't you celebrate with me\
what i have shaped into a kind of life? i had no model.\
born in babylon\
both nonwhite and\
woman what did i see to be except myself?\
i made it up\
here on this bridge between\
starshine and clay,\
my one hand holding tight\
my other hand; come celebrate\
with me that everyday\
something has tried to kill me\
and has failed.
