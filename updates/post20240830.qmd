## Goal

To get this new notebook setup up and running with a few call-out blog entries that are longer documentations of the work than the daily posts

## Project

Lab Notebook Cleanup

## Purpose

Trying to simplify the entry process so that I can capture decisions, data, anything that influenced the outcomes of a project

## Process

Wipe out all of the bells an whistles and get the basics right. Get consistent.
