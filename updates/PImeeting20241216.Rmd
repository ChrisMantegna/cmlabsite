* Attended BIMS Week and presented my educator workshop
* Continued working with Kai and Darian with their SICB project analysis
* Finished data cleaning with Noah and identified missing data that he is entering from summer data sheets
* Submitted travel needs for Noah and I
* Got AGU content for RUA out the door (flyer design and print, application process walk-through, stickers ordered and shipped, sent website content for revamp to ConMar)

The projects that have been completed:
BIMS Week Workshop: Base curricula, preliminary website where it will be housed, and feedback from the in-person curricula review. [Site]()
SICB Travel: all students booked except for Noah & I and that process is moving through approvals

## Previous 2 Week Progress

The last 2 weeks were vacation with individual task management including managing RUA (sa-ship) work. Most notable progress:\

-   BIMS workshop. Created all needed curricula. Compiled resources and explainers for open source platforms, community builders, curriculum development method and pedagogy theories used. GH quarto page in the works as the dissemination platform.\

-   Data cleaning and analysis with 3 Yellow students on their SICB projects\

## Project Needs/ Updates (not outlined above)

**Innovation Grant**\
- Spending\
- Update on Althea & Umut's one time payment\
- Have they received it, should I reach out to Tivon or anyone else to check status?\
- Rosalind's honorarium\
- Do I need to initiate that?\

**SICB**\
- Worktags for Noah and I to cover registration, lodging and flight for Noah, and lodging and flight for me\
-- Noah= 205 registration, 600 flight, 200 lodging\
-- Me= 600 flight, 500 lodging\

**Biomarker paper**\
- Haven't talked to Alison. Will reach out\
- Updated results section (will tag)\
- Alternative correlation plot (is it worth it?)\
- Introduction is a mess\
- Discussion is still an outline\

## Priorities (next 2 weeks)

-   Biomarker paper (overdue)
-   BIMS Workshop website (deadline 12/4)
-   Data analysis with Kai and Noah (in progress)

## Long term priorities (within the next 2 months)

**Ecotox Course design**\
- When is the deadline for 2025 spring course add?\
- Can we set aside a course design working session for December after 12/10?\
**Bypass Package**Â  - Deadline 2/15/25\
- Master's proposal based on biomarkers and eDNA results\
- Deliver nlt 12.31.24\
- PhD proposal\
- Need to set late Dec or early Jan weekly meetings to work through\

## Questions for SR

-   Do you have the science hour recording from Nov 1 - I'd like to rewatch how Sam moved our files so I can get my eDNA sequences over to our servers from my Google Drive.\

## Other news/ For your awareness...

-   Taking SMEA 550 Qualitative Methods in winter quarter\
-   Applied to the summer BIOL 200 Lecturer role\
-   Looking at the NOAA NCCOS funding call - this does tie to my PhD proposal work and could cover other lab work\
